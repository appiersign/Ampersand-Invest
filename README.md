```bash
$ docker-compose up

```

Build and run container:

```bash
$ docker build -t buildable . 
$ docker run -d -p 4200:80 buildable
```

The app will be available at http://localhost:4200

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests
